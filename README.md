# Password-Generator-Web-Application-using-Python-HTML-and-CSS
The Password Generator Web Application is a simple and secure tool built using Python (Flask), HTML, and CSS. It allows users to generate strong and random passwords by choosing the desired length and character types such as uppercase letters, digits, and symbols.
The application uses Python’s built-in random and string modules to create unpredictable combinations, ensuring password strength and security. The user interacts through a clean, responsive interface where they can generate and copy passwords instantly. This project not only helps users maintain better digital security but also demonstrates the integration of web development technologies with Python programming, making it an ideal educational and practical mini-project.
